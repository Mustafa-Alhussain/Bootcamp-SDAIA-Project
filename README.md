# KC House Price Precition

# Abstract
This project aims to assist stakeholders, i.e. home buyers or real estate agents, in predicting the sale price of King county homes while demonstrating general trends in the market. Housing price trends are not only the concern of buyers and sellers, but it also indicates the current economic situation. This project uses an open source dataset, which include 20 explanatory features and 21,613 entries of housing sales in King County, USA. The paper involves predictions using various Regression techniques like linear regression, random forest regression, AdaBoostregression, and many others algorithms. Additionally, both feature engineering and feature reduction are performed throughout the analysis to reach to determine most effective model.

# Design
Online property companies offer valuations of houses using machine learning techniques. The aim of this report is to predict the house sales in King County, Washington State, USA using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Predicting house price accurately via machine learning models would enable government take action to ensure that companies don't manipulate the prices not to mention to ensure house prices are accessible to as many people as possible.

# Data
For this study, we collected data from the website named “Kaggle”-(https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions in which statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the datasets uploaded by companies and users.

The dataset used in this project contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations.
